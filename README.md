Hey reader/visitor! I see you've arrived at the source code for my repository. Feel free to look around!

I've created this site to show my qualifications as a frontend/React developer with 5+ years of experience. This is a work-in-progress and I will be making more improvements to it periodically. You'll find my skills, career experience, what I am working on currently, as well as a little of what I like doing when I am not typing code.
