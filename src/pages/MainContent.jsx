          I'm <b>Ameya Joshi</b>,&nbsp;a Frontend/React developer based in the
          Oklahoma City metro area, with 5+ years of professional experience
          that includes <b>React</b> and <b>TypeScript</b>, among a host of
          other tools. I enjoy web development, am an avid aviation enthusiast
          and have a Meteorology degree as well. I call it the "three-way cloud
          connection". In keeping with that theme, each aircraft window's shade
          below will reveal links to pages showing my credentials, career
          experience and on what I am working, as well as projects I have
          recently completed. Intrigued? Check it out!
