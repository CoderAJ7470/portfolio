      `Tech stack was mainly NodeJS and AngularJS, so definitely outside my usual front-end comfort zone. Also had HTML 5, CSS 3 and JS, plus some Java backend`,
      `I took the challenge head-on, which was made easier with all of the great support and
       collaboration from my peers`,
      `I handled varying tasks, from as simple as removing old Java backend code to handling
       complicated api-driven dynamic data handling, with some small frontend tasks sprinkled in`,
      `I did get a chance to do some more "involved" frontend work towards the end of the project,
       which looked simple on paper but was made more complex because of the structure of the code - adding a link in the footer. This was to be done on multiple pages in the monorepo. Eventually, this involved many colleagues working across several pages at the same time, and the lead developer on the Sparq team put me in charge of the footer changes, keeping track of which page's footer had the link and which still needed it. While nothing earth-shattering, it was a good first experience in collaboration and communication across different teams`,

      `The core tech stack on this project was React and TypeScript on the frontend, with NodeJS on the backend as well as GraphQL and Grafana. We also made extensive use of APIs.`,
      `Being on the frontend team, I helped the client re-build its all-in-one suite of IT spend management software from the ground up. I rebuilt several components in React and used TypeScript for functionality.`,
      `In addition to that, I had the opportunity to work with several new-to-me technologies at the time. These included Storybook, amCharts 4 and AG Grid.`,
      `I also worked on improving Outlook email templates, where I introduced dynamic content like names and dates; also worked extensively on enabling translations throughout the app for Spanish and French`,
      `Last but not least, I was also given the opportunity to lead routine meetings like the daily standup, sprint retrospective and sprint planning. Leading these further developed my soft skills`,

      `The main focus for me on this project was to add accessibility to two of the client's apps - one internal, one public-facing`,
      `The frontend code base on this project was also in React and TypeScript, with NodeJS, APIs and other backend code`,
      `This was my first deep-dive into accessibility in web apps, so I took the time to really learn what it's about, how it works and get familiar with the various specifications of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1`,
      `I learned and used semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, the browser WAVE Tool extension and the WCAG color contrast checker`,
      `Also learned how the NVDA screen reader works, and thoroughly tested it in both web apps to ensure correct functionality`,

      `This project's main goal was to help the client build a new SMS-based app. Using the app, the client's rental agents are able to communicate with their customers solely through texts for car and truck rentals.`,
      `The original app had some fundamental issues and bugs which I helped resolve initially after joining the project team. Once again, the tech stack on this project included React and TypeScript, giving me further experience with both. On the backend, we had APIs, NodeJS and custom lambdas written in JavaScript, as well as an AWS environment.`,
      `I worked with both, the frontend and backend teams on the Sparq and client side to help build out the app's features and improve existing code`,
      `The bulk of my work involved various UI features, from as basic as sending/receiving text messages and showing conversations, to more complex ones like populating filtered API data in search results, searching for closed conversations or showing conversation history for a particular rental or reservation`,
      `From time to time, I paired up with backend team colleagues to help with timeline-driven tasks or fix bugs, which involved querying data with Splunk and/or Postman, and also conducting specialized searches in AWS. Occasionally, I also helped the QA team with its own tasks when time was on the short side.`,
      `In addition to all that, I also worked on implementing accessibility and translations in the app, using my experience gained in both areas from the previous two client projects`,
